# Project 1: Flexing Your Muscles

## Brief

You'll be using what we learned from class so far to create a one-page website. The theme of the website is going to be some kind of product or service that you want to sell.

Examples:

- [https://onepagelove.com](https://onepagelove.com)
- [https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?categories=55](https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?categories=55)
- [http://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/web-designs/type/product?page=1](http://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/web-designs/type/product?page=1)

## Requirements

- At least one breakpoint that makes this site usable within a mobile context.
- Use flexbox in some capacity to lay out your site.

## Getting Started

- Fork the [starter repo project](https://github.com/thebsides/kcc-nma-art258-starter) on github.com (not your desktop GitHub client).
- Rename the project "kcc-nma-art258-project-X" where X is the number of the project.
- After forking the project, make sure you're in the "plain" branch until we're used to using Gulp.
- Open up the GitHub Desktop Client and clone your repository.
- Create a new branch from the project called "gh-pages".
- Go ahead and start working.

## Due Date & How to Hand This In

This project will be due by the beginning of class on Thursday, September 15.

Simply committing to the repo will be "turning it in", as your page will show up at http://_username_.github.io/_project-name_
